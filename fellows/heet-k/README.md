## What this folder is

Two threads of Medhavy work, kept separate because they reached different states
at different times:

1. **Channel brand identity** — the Medhavy intro and outro stings, from first
   logo-reel passes through professor-confirmed final masters in 16:9, 9:16 and 4K.
2. **The `sri-explainer` skill** — a chapter-to-video explainer that narrates a
   Prof Sridhar textbook chapter in Sridhar's own written register, plus the two
   Quantum Mechanics Vol. 1 chapter videos built as its first real test.

Source, beat sheets, scene code and skill definitions live here. Rendered masters
live in Drive and are linked per week below, per the repo's
[GitHub-for-source / Drive-for-renders rule](../README.md#github-for-source-and-assets-drive-for-renders).

## Channel organization

| Week | Work | Result | Evidence | Log |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [21–27 Sep](./2026-09-24-channel-reorganization/) | Channel cleanup and content plan | Unnecessary videos unlisted/removed — completed. Structure and content plan at **Phase 1**, self-directed, not externally reviewed. | NOT PROVIDED — no capture or artifact of the channel state | [log](./2026-09-24-channel-reorganization/FRICTIONAL.md) |

## Voice

The `claude-sri` beat sheets declare `engine: kokoro`, `voice_kokoro: am_onyx`
— the male Kokoro voice, and the only male voice the brutalist toolkit's
`generate_audio_kokoro.py` ships. `sri-explainer` reuses it from `claude-liam`
as an interim default; Prof Sridhar does not yet have a voice of his own, which
would mean extending `ALLOWED_VOICES` first. That has not been done.

Honest exception: the Medhavy logo-reel beat sheet carries an ElevenLabs
`voice_id`, not a Kokoro voice — the brand stings predate the Kokoro-only rule.
Recorded as-is rather than retro-edited.

## Hours

[HOURS.md](HOURS.md) — weekly hours, reconstructed by the volunteer, not measured time.

## Known gaps

Stated rather than omitted, per the [fellows reporting standard](https://www.humanitarians.ai/fellows):

- **No YouTube links.** None of the finished videos above has a public viewing URL recorded here.
- **`Medhavy_Cancer_Tutorial_1_4K.mp4`** (Drive, 17 Sep, 185.7 MB) has no beat sheet, script
  or scene code anywhere in the source tree. It is a render with no evidence behind it and is
  therefore not claimed as a work folder.
- **Weeks 4–11** are referenced in the weekly reports ("Week 6's first-pass footage") but
  have no Drive folder or work folder here. This package covers 17 Aug onward only.
- **The GitHub commit** that shipped the `sri-explainer` skill (Week 15) is confirmed to exist
  by the weekly report but its hash is not recorded.
- **Outro source** — the outro scene code and beat sheet are not in the local source tree;
  only the rendered outros are in Drive.
- **Professor confirmations** are reported by the volunteer; no countersignature is included.
- The Frictional logs were written on 2026-09-28, after the weeks they describe, and each one
  says so.
