## Lane summary
- MANIM: all 9 beats, self-contained in this reel's own `scenes.py`. No
  pantry stills, no Remotion components, no `brutalist/` toolkit changes.
- Style/palette/helpers (PALETTE, `T()`, `fit()`, `panel()`,
  `clear_of_divider()`, `box_around()`, `inline_highlight()`) copied from
  this fellow's closest siblings
  `2026-09-14-rag-why-looking-it-up-isnt-enough` and
  `2026-09-14-b3-the-link-that-pointed-nowhere` (same fellow, same voice,
  same series) for house-style consistency.
- Every quoted string on screen (B03's scoring rule, B04's two real titles
  and trigger-word contexts, B05's fail-open branch wording, B06's 3-case
  table, B07's 3 limitations) is verbatim from
  `/Users/pranavijs/mycroft/scripts/regulatory-intel/C2-VERIFICATION.md` —
  see `SOURCES.md`'s claim -> source mapping. Nothing paraphrased.
- B04 is this reel's most legibility-critical beat: the trigger word is
  shown ALONE first (as the keyword scorer effectively "sees" it), then in
  its real, harmless context — both real titles, side by side.
- B05 explicitly shows the fail-open branch as its own reveal (not bundled
  silently with confirm/downgrade) — this reel's single most
  safety-critical visual element per `FACTCHECK.md`/`BEAT-SHEET.md`'s
  Legibility Contract.
- B06 shows all 3 outcomes together (not sequential reveals that hide the
  comparison), with the SEC row's label per `FACTCHECK.md` item #1
  (resolved): "not reviewed — below alert threshold", never implying it was
  reviewed-and-approved.
- B07's 3 limitations are shown at full weight, none softened or omitted
  (`FACTCHECK.md` resolution for this beat).
