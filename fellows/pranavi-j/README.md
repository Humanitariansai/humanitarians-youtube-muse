# Sai Pranavi Jeedigunta

Weekly research reports on Humanitarians AI project work, documented as it happens.

## Voice

**Bella (`af_bella`)**, confirmed 2026-07-26. The name-based heuristic in
[`fellows/README.md`](../README.md) originally suggested Kore (`af_kore`),
but that voice doesn't exist in the installed `brutalist` toolkit — it only
ships two Kokoro voices, Onyx (`am_onyx`) and Bella (`af_bella`). Bella
matches the `hai` persona and `@HumanitariansAI` channel and is now locked in
for the full report series.

The first three were rebuilt 2026-08-26/28 for program-wide submission requirements: 4K (3840x2160), a title card + executive-summary opening beat, a 9:16 vertical companion (real Manim portrait relayout, not a crop), and self-assessment against each project's `PROOF.md`. Final deliverables are named per the fellowship convention (`Mycroft_SaiPranaviJeedigunta_<date>_<aspect>.mp4` for the weekly-work video, `<TopicName>_SaiPranaviJeedigunta_<date>_<aspect>.mp4` for the weekly-STEM videos) and live inside each project folder alongside the paperwork; code/paperwork for each is pushed to `github.com/nikbearbrown/humanitarians-youtube` on its own branch (see each project's `README.md` for the exact branch/commit).

The three 2026-08-30 reports (two weekly-work, one weekly-STEM) were all built natively to spec from the start (4K, both aspect ratios, exec-summary beat, naming convention) rather than rebuilt after the fact:

- **Weekly work (1st):** a real Layer 1 fix (a "Mark email sent" step re-deriving its own high-priority rule instead of reading the email step's actual output) with all on-screen numbers traced to `A7-VERIFICATION.md` and re-verified live against the database at build time — see its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`.
- **Weekly STEM:** a framework-first explainer teaching a reusable 3-question rubric (Source / Instruction-or-Data / Consequence) for whether an AI agent should act on external text, with a worked example, a falsifiability stress-test, and a scaffolded audit task — self-assessed 11/12 against `PROOF.md` — see its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`/`PEDAGOGY.md`.
- **Weekly work (2nd):** a second Layer 1 fix in the same pipeline — a source classifier rule specifically written to catch CFTC filings that, tested against every live CFTC item, matched zero of them (the rule checked for text patterns that structurally can't appear in Federal Register permalinks/titles) — fixed by reading the feed's real `dc:creator` field instead of guessing. Named `Mycroft_SaiPranaviJeedigunta_20260830b_*` (suffixed `b` since two weekly-work videos landed the same day) — see its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`.

The 2026-09-07 reports (one weekly-work, one weekly-STEM):

- **Weekly work (4th in the Layer 1 series):** a partial fix, honestly reported — 18 Google News items were falling through the source classifier to "Unknown Source" (no `dc:creator` field to fall back on this time); 10 of 18 recovered via feed-agnostic synonym keywords (`adviser`/`RIA`, `broker-dealer`/`Reg BI`), with the remaining 8 explicitly left open as a deliberate tradeoff rather than an unsolved bug — see its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`.
- **Weekly STEM:** a framework-first explainer on when to use keyword matching vs. embeddings — chosen because it explains the general pattern underneath this fellow's last several weekly-work bugs (brittle exact-match rules breaking as real-world text varies), though kept fully generic with fictional examples, not a report of any specific fix. Its meaning-space scatter diagrams (B04/B05) needed 3 rounds of layout fixes after the automated frame-QC tool failed to catch a real content-distribution defect (a small cluster of points confined to one region of a much larger panel) — resolved by direct visual inspection of extracted frames across each beat's full runtime, not by trusting the tool's reported numbers. A follow-up patch also fixed a real low-contrast palette bug (a text color measuring 1.16:1 against its panel background, WCAG minimum is 4.5:1) and a text/panel-border overlap the toolkit's own layout auditor caught. See its `BUILD-LOG.md` for the full account.

## Naming/format convention

The first 8 reports (2026-07-26 through 2026-09-07) use the original fellowship naming
(`Mycroft_SaiPranaviJeedigunta_<date>_<aspect>.mp4` / `<TopicName>_SaiPranaviJeedigunta_<date>_<aspect>.mp4`,
4K 16:9 + 1080x1920 9:16 short) and are being **kept exactly as built** — no retroactive renaming
or re-rendering.

**Starting with the 2026-09-14 reports**, submissions switch to the toolkit's own official spec
(`brutalist/docs/FELLOWS-SUBMISSION.md`, introduced 2026-09-07): `ProjectName_VolunteerName.mp4`
(no date, no aspect suffix in the filename), separate `deliverables/landscape/`/`deliverables/vertical/`
folders instead of a filename suffix, and a true 4K **2160x3840 full-length vertical companion**
(via the toolkit's `./art vertical` command — a native portrait relayout of the whole video, not a
≤180s Shorts-style cut) instead of the 1080x1920 short used above.

The two 2026-09-14 reports are the first built under this new spec:

- **Weekly work (5th in the Layer 1 series), "The Link That Pointed Nowhere":** every Google News
  item's stored link was a dead-end redirect (the `url=` regex it relied on doesn't match modern
  Google News links); the fix reverse-engineers how Google News's own page resolves the real URL,
  with an on-screen caveat that this is an undocumented/reverse-engineered mechanism, not a stable
  API. Along the way, a classification-ordering near-miss was caught before shipping — it would
  have silently undone two prior weeks' fixes. Two honest limitations kept at full weight: unverified
  against the fellow's live n8n instance, and ~400 extra requests/run by design. Named
  `GoogleNewsLinkFix_SaiPranaviJeedigunta.mp4`. GATE V: 0 BLOCKER/0 MAJOR on both masters — see its
  `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`.
- **Weekly STEM, "RAG: Why 'Looking It Up' Doesn't Guarantee It's True":** a framework-first
  explainer teaching a 3-question rubric (Relevant / Current / Grounded) for whether a
  Retrieval-Augmented-Generation answer is actually grounded in what it retrieved, with a stale-document
  worked example, a falsifiability case where retrieval genuinely is the fix, and a scaffolded audit
  task. Self-assessed 11/12 against `PROOF.md`. Named `RAGGrounding_SaiPranaviJeedigunta.mp4` — see
  its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`/`PEDAGOGY.md`.

Two further weekly-work reports (2026-09-22, backdated to catch up on a missed submission week,
and 2026-09-29), both built under the same new submission spec and both under the renamed
`fellows/pranavi-j/` path (see "Fellow folder rename" below):

- **Weekly work (6th in the Layer 1 series), "The All-Clear That Wasn't All There":** the
  pipeline's "no new items" status email listed only 4 of its 5 real monitored RSS feeds
  (Investment Advisor Rules missing from both the source grid and the summary line). Fixed and
  verified by diffing every source-card label against the workflow's real feed-node names. Also
  closed a stale `FINDINGS.md` note ("apply A4/B4 to Generate Email") that turned out to already
  be fixed since the very first hardening commit. Named `AllClearEmailFix_SaiPranaviJeedigunta.mp4`.
  GATE V: 0 BLOCKER/0 MAJOR on both masters — see its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`.
- **Weekly work (7th in the Layer 1 series), "The Keyword That Cried Wolf":** built and verified a
  local-LLM (Ollama, `llama3.2:3b`) second-pass review targeting the two C1 keyword-misfire
  patterns named in `FINDINGS.md` — a Medicare rule scored 10/Critical from the word "emergency"
  inside a law's proper name, and a boilerplate Nasdaq filing scored 9/Critical from "Immediate
  Effectiveness." Verified live against both false positives plus a genuine true positive (the SEC
  insider-trading case); fail-open behavior verified separately (an Ollama outage doesn't break the
  pipeline). Ollama wasn't even installed on the dev machine before this fix — installed, model
  pulled, and tested live in-session. Named `KeywordReScoring_SaiPranaviJeedigunta.mp4`. GATE V: 0
  BLOCKER/0 MAJOR (landscape), 0 BLOCKER/2 MAJOR (vertical, both on the B08 brand card, borderline
  underfill at the 55% floor, personally confirmed legible) — see its `README.md`/`BUILD-LOG.md`.
  Both mycroft fixes behind these two videos are pushed to `github.com/SaiPranaviJeedigunta/mycroft`,
  branch `feature/regulatory-intelligence-hardening` (commit `3e32894`), documented in
  `B5-VERIFICATION.md` and `C2-VERIFICATION.md`.

## Fellow folder rename

This folder was renamed from `fellows/sai-pranavi-j/` to `fellows/pranavi-j/` as part of an
org-wide fellows-folder normalization (first-name-last-initial convention) applied across the
whole `humanitarians-youtube` repo. All 8 prior reports carried over unchanged. A new
`FRICTIONAL.md` requirement was introduced alongside the rename (a per-work-subfolder, ungraded
process log — see the repo-wide fellows guidance for what an entry contains).
